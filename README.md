# WiBLE
Developed a unified local network scanner for detecting nearby Wi-Fi and Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) devices. The tool features rogue access point (AP) detection by comparing scanned SSIDs against a trusted baseline. Built with a browser-based interface and compiled into a standalone .exe installer for easy distribution without requiring Python.
